**TouchNote Assignment**

I have created an assignment which includes below functionality.

1. Created an app in clean architecture and jetpack compose.
2. Used API : https://gorest.co.in/public/v2/posts to fetch the data from the server
3. Added different states while fetching data like: Loading, error and success response.
4. Managed the UI to look neat and clean.
